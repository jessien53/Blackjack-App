# Blackjack-App

## Overview
This Java Blackjack Application was developed as a project for the Software Design class at UIC's Computer Science Department. The application allows users to play a game of blackjack against a computer dealer, with a user-friendly graphical interface.

## Features
- **JavaFX Front End**: The front end of the application is built using JavaFX, providing a visually appealing and interactive user interface.
- **Java Back End**: The Java backend handles game logic, ensuring seamless gameplay and adherence to blackjack rules.
- **Wireframe Design**: Wireframes for the application were designed using Figma, outlining the graphical components and transitions between scenes.
- **Test Suites**: Test suites were developed and executed to verify the functionality of backend classes, ensuring accurate game logic and card dealing.
- **Comprehensive User Experience**: The application incorporates features such as setting the starting amount of money, changing bet amounts, and displaying remaining money, providing a comprehensive user experience.
- **Graphical Representation**: Graphical elements representing cards were designed, with logical and visible color choices, enhancing the visual appeal of the application.

## Rules of the Game
The game follows the standard rules of blackjack with the following specifications:

Two players: banker and user.
User interacts with the game through a GUI.
At the start, two cards are dealt to each player, with the first dealer card hidden.
User can choose to "hit" to receive another card or "stay" to end their turn.
User busts if their hand value exceeds 21.
Dealer must hit on hands 16 and lower and stay on hands 17 and higher.
The player with the higher hand wins. A draw occurs if both players have the same value hand.
A player who hits 21 on two cards gets "blackjack" and wins 150% of their bet unless both players hit "blackjack", resulting in a draw.

## Usage
To run the application:

Ensure you have Java and Maven installed.
Clone the repository.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run mvn clean compile exec:java to start the application.
